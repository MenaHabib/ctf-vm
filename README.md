# ctf-vm

This is my CTF VM script.  It is an amalgamation of my own dotfiles and customization, some [customizations from g0tmi1k](https://github.com/g0tmi1k/os-scripts), the guts of [EpicTreasure](https://github.com/ctfhacker/EpicTreasure) from [ctfhacker](http://ctfhacker.com/), and an installer for the [Penetration Testers Framework](https://github.com/TrustedSec/ptf) by TrustedSec.

I currently run this in an Ubuntu 16.04 VM.
